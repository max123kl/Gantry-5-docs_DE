During the development of the Gantry Framework, we found that we needed to organize sets of parameters into custom groups of related settings. You can create your own elements in *template-options.xml* to allow the setting of specific parameters which you can use later in your own features, layouts, etc. A good example of this is the **inactive** chain that controls what menu item should be displayed when the menu is inactive. The XML in question looks like this:

```xml
<fields name="inactive" type="chain" label="INACTIVE"  description="INACTIVE_DESC">
    <field name="enabled" type="toggle" default="1" label="ENABLED"  setinmenuitem="false" />
    <field name="menuitem" type="menuitem" label="SELECT_MENU_ITEM" setinmenuitem="false" />
</fields>
```

This parameter block consists of a parent **chain** element. This element has a name called **inactive**. Within the chain, are two elements. One is a toggle called **enabled**, and the other is a menuitem element named **menuitem**.

Now, you could get the values of these parameters just by using the call:

```php
global $gantry;
echo $gantry->get('inactive-enabled');
echo $gantry->get('inactive-menuitem');
```

However, within Gantry we have a feature to handle the 'inactive' state, and therefore we have a core feature called **GantryFeatureInactive** that looks like this:

```php
class GantryFeatureInactive extends GantryFeature {
    var $_feature_name = 'inactive';

    function init() {
        global $gantry, $Itemid;

        $enabled = $this->get('enabled');
        if($enabled) {
            $menus = &JSite::getMenu();
            $menu  = $menus->getActive();
            if (null == $menu){
                $menuitem = $this->get('menuitem');
                $menus->setActive($menuitem);
                $Itemid = $menuitem;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Features, by default, are looking for a chained set of parameters. So, by setting the `$_feature_name` to **inactive**, and using the feature's own built in `get()` method, we don't need to use the full **inactive-menuitem** chained name. The feature's method automatically prefixes the feature name to obtain the correct parameter.

During development of the Gantry Framework, we found that we needed to organize sets of parameters into custom groups of related settings. You can create your own elements in `templateDetails.xml` to allow the setting of specific parameters which you can use later in your own features, layouts, etc. A good example of this is the **pagesuffix** chain that controls any extra CSS classes which should be added to the `<body>` tag. The XML in question looks like this:

```xml
<fields name="pagesuffix" type="chain" label="PAGESUFFIX" description="PAGESUFFIX_DESC">
    <field name="enabled" type="toggle" default="0" label="ENABLED" enabler="true" />
    <field name="class" type="text" default="" class="text-long" label="CLASS"/>
    <field name="priority" type="hidden" default="2"/>
</fields>
```

This parameter block consists of a parent **chain** element. This element has a name called **pagesuffix**. Within the chain, are three elements. One is a toggle called **enabled**, the second a text element named **class**, and third is responsible for the **priority**.

Now, you could get the values of these parameters just by using the call:

```php
global $gantry;
echo $gantry->get('pagesuffix-enabled');
echo $gantry->get('pagesuffix-menuitem');
```

Within Gantry, we have a feature to handle the `pagesuffix` state. This gives us a core gizmo called **GantryGizmoPageSuffix**.

Here's what it looks like:

```php
class GantryGizmoPageSuffix extends GantryGizmo {
    var $_name = 'pagesuffix';

    function query_parsed_init()
    {

        /** @global $gantry Gantry */
        global $gantry;

        //add body class suffix
        $gantry->addBodyClass($gantry->get('pagesuffix-class'));

    }

}
```

Gizmos, by default, are looking for a chained set of parameters. By setting the `$_feature_name` to **pagesuffix**, and using the feature's own built in `get()` method, we don't need to use the full **pagesuffix-class** chained name. The gizmos method automatically prefixes the feature name to obtain the correct parameter.

WordPress Options
=====

Below are additional options in the Style tab which are specific to the WordPress platform.

Pagination
-------------------
The *Pagination Settings* setting allows you to decide how the pagination between content pages should look. This parameter allows you to decide if user should be able to see total number of pages, and how many side pages should be displayed next to the current page.

Custom CSS
-------------------
The *Custom CSS* setting allows you to input your own, custom CSS code that will be added inline to the head section of the page. This way you can add custom styling (globally or per-override) to your page without modifying any of the template files.

The **Extras** dropdown gives you quick access to a few options that are handy to have instant access to throughout the administrator. This includes the **Development Mode** toggle switch, a **Clear Cache** shortcut, and a shortcut to **Platform Settings** which takes you to a platform-specific settings page for Gantry.

## Development and Production Modes

There is a process running in Gantry 5 that enables you to activate **Development** and **Production** modes. The **Development** toggle switch in the **Extras** areas of the Gantry administrator enables you to toggle between these modes as needed.

When in **Development**, any change made to your SCSS (such as `custom.scss`) / Twig / YAML files will be automatically detected by Gantry and will only require a quick refresh on the frontend to view your changes. This makes it easy to make changes on the fly and have them appear on your site without having to [**Recompile CSS**](../styles#controls) in the Styles tab or [**Clear Cache**](#clear-cache).

Once you place your site in **Production** mode you will need to [**Clear Cache**](#clear-cache) to view changes to Twig / YAML files and [**Recompile CSS**](../styles#controls) in the Styles tab to view changes to SCSS files. The benefit of putting your site in **Production** mode is that your SCSS files will be minified. This should be done once you're ready to make your website live.

In the future, more **Development** vs. **Production** actions will be tied to this same setting, such as cache, minified vs. extended JS/CSS, etc.

#### Umschalten Alternative

![Production](production.png?classes=shadow,border)

There is an alternative method for toggling this feature, accessible by navigating to **Administrator → Extensions → Plugin Manager** and selecting the **System - Gantry 5** plugin.

You can also use this settings page to toggle **Asset Timestamps**. This feature adds timestamps on changed asset files, like images, CSS and JS. This option tells the browser to retrieve fresh assets without forcing reload on the page. NOTE: Timestamps are always enabled in development mode.

The **Timestamp Period** field enables you to set the number of days which a timestamp is kept after updating the file. You can enter whole or decimal numbers (example: 0.5, 12, 21, 3, etc.). Set to **0** to add timestamps on every single asset file.
